[Notes]

=>no validation performed so there will some unexpected errors 

=>this app can perform Crud with api and also without api 

=>i have created two separete project one is api and another one is .net core web app then merged both in one 


Example of urls Using Api:


 

get:http://localhost:55360/api/studentApi/getAllStudent


post:http://localhost:55360/api/studentApi/InsertStudent  Json Format{"id":0[as id is identity],
                                                          "StudentName":"","Address":""."Phone":"","Email":""}


put:http://localhost:55360/api/studentApi/InsertStudent  Json Format{"id":selected Id[as id is identity],
                                                          "StudentName":"","Address":""."Phone":"","Email":""}
